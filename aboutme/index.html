          some few years back and decided to enroll in BYU pathway worldwide 
          program for reliable and affordable courses</p>

    <p>I'm currently a freshman BYU-Idaho online student taking bachelor in 
        applied Technology as my major. In this first week of the semester,
        I'm so far happy to be a part of BYU and I'm expecting to gain much so 
        that I may became a disciple leader in few years to come.</p>        
     
    <p>I'm an enterprenuer curretly working in my self employed business of selling
        fast food. I own a food stand where I sell these fast food in event markets 
        as well as busy streets within my town. The business has been the source of 
        my livelihood and a platform to nurture my interpersonal skills.</p>
        
    <p>I'm so passionate to learn web design as a skill to build my future career and 
        I'm optimistic that I will achieve my best at the end of the course. I believe

        and so I believe that I will do my best in it.</p>
